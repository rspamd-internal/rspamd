The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Rspamd and its packages, which are hosted in the [Rspamd Organization](https://github.com/rspamd) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. This contribution policy is heavily inspired by [Atom editor](https://github.com/atom/atom).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Rspamd. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report
* Read about bug reporting in general: https://rspamd.com/doc/faq.html#how-to-report-bugs-found-in-rspamd
* Enable relevant debugging logs: https://rspamd.com/doc/faq.html#how-to-debug-some-module-in-rspamd 
* Check the FAQs about Core files in case of fatal crash: https://rspamd.com/doc/faq.html#how-to-figure-out-why-rspamd-process-crashed
* Check that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Arspamd
* Check that there is not already an experimental package or master branch

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Rspamd, e.g. which custom configuration are you using, or what message have you scanned. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If you're reporting that Atom crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system: https://rspamd.com/doc/faq.html#how-to-figure-out-why-rspamd-process-crashed
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atom?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from [the releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to scanning messages, **does the problem happen for all messages  or only some?**

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Rspamd are you using?** 
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **What hardware are you using, including CPU generation**, e.g. Intel Haswell or ArmV7? If you have `gcc` installed, that could be achieved by the following command: `gcc -march=native -Q --help=target|grep march`. In Linux, you can also check `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the required details.
