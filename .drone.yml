  # We run rspamd-test (unit test) and functional test (runned by robot) in
  # parallel to save time. To avoid conflict in saving lua coverage we run them
  # from different directories. For C code coverage counters is saved to .gcda
  # files and binary contain absolute path to them, so rspamd-test and
  # processes started by functional test are writing to the same files. On
  # process exit new coverage data merged with existing content of .gcda file.
  # Race is possible if rspamd-test and some rspamd process in functional test
  # will try to write .gcda file simultaneous.  But it is very unlikely and
  # performance is more important then correct coverage data.
